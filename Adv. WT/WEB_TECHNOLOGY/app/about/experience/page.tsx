            </div>
            <div className="col-lg-4 ms-auto"><p className="lead">Over the past year, I’ve worked on several academic and personal projects that reflect real-world scenarios — from building responsive websites to developing complete full-stack applications. One of my major projects included converting a static education template into a dynamic Next.js app, which involved layout optimization, TypeScript integration, and component structuring using the App Router. I’ve also developed a Flutter-based matrimony app, incorporating user authentication, drawer navigation, and Lottie animations.</p></div>
            <div className="col-lg-4 me-auto"><p className="lead">Beyond project work, I regularly collaborate with peers, solve coding challenges, and contribute to GitHub repositories to sharpen my skills. My practical experience includes debugging client-side issues, refactoring inefficient code, and ensuring accessibility and SEO compliance. These real-world exercises have not only improved my technical capabilities but also built my confidence in handling professional software development tasks.</p></div>
